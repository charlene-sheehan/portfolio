    <h3>Designing Started Young</h3>
		<p>I first started designing as a child. My father worked in the golf manufacturing industry, which often meant he was away for the holidays in China. I designed my own e-cards for him every holiday. Those cards lead to a golf logo design since he wasn't any good at the computer. My 16th birthday was very sweet when he gave me my first driver, which was imprinted with my logo. A lot has changed since I was a teen, but my enthusiasm for creating and capabilities to do so have only grown.
		<br>Rather than flexing my imagination on PaintShopPro 8, I'm working with up-to-date professional-grade programs to make quality web work inside and out. Good design can't function without well thought out coding.

          <h4>Sample Webpage</h4>
          <p>This is an example portfolio site that exudes a professionalism with a feminine touch. A website's look and feel could be the client's first impression of your business and you want to start off on the right foot. </p>
