    <h3>about me</h3>
    <img src="img/about-photo.JPG" alt="bio-photo"/>
      <p>When I'm not teaching or studying, I love to get lost in art galleries and lost myself in the vast views of cathedrals.
      <br> When in <s>Rome</s> Madrid?, right</p>
    <h4> designing started young</h4>
      <p> I first started designing as a child. My father worked in the golf manufacturing industry, which often meant he was away for the holidays in China. I designed my own e-cards for him every holiday. Those cards lead to a golf logo design since he wasn't any good at the computer. My 16th birthday was very sweet when he gave me my first driver, which was imprinted with my logo. I developed an eye for detail through my years studying linguistics. </p>

      	<p> My life is spent between my life-long home in Southern California and newfound home in Madrid, Spain.
    	<p>My journey into tech started with a young-life crisis after my first year in Spain. I loved teaching in Spain, but for many reasons, found that it wasn't a feasible option for me in the near future. While musing about starting a blog, I stumbled into all the opportunities that there are in tech.
        <p>With nothing to lose and only coding skills to gain, I dove in headfirst with the Skillcrush online coding school. The founders of the company inspire me to build my future div by div while I'm still teaching kiddos English in Spain. I'm pursuing front-end and wordpress development. </p>
