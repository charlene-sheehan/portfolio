      <p>When I'm not teaching or studying, I love to get lost in art galleries and lost myself in the vast views of cathedrals.
      <br> When in <s>Rome</s> Madrid?, right</p>

    <div class="half-width" id="about-description">
      <p> My life is spent between my life-long home in Southern California and newfound home in Madrid, Spain.
        <p>My journey into tech started with a young-life crisis after my first year in Spain. I loved teaching in Spain, but for many reasons, found that it wasn't a feasible option for me in the near future. While musing about starting a blog, I stumbled into all the opportunities that there are in tech.
        <p>With nothing to lose and only coding skills to gain, I dove in headfirst with the Skillcrush online coding school. The founders of the company inspire me to build my future div by div while I'm still teaching kiddos English in Spain. I'm pursuing front-end and wordpress development. </p>
